Description

Padaco is data visualization and analysis tool for accelerometry data obtained from a wearable device.
It currently supports Actigraph's GT3X+ sensor. You can use the software to visualize this sensor data,
which includes tri-axial accelerometry (X,Y,Z axis and their vector magnitude), luminance, and some other
derived measures (e.g. step count and inclination).

Version history
1.85
- Export menu options added
  - Save activity states from single study to disk
  - Export clusters to disk for external processing.
- Import outcomes data to pair with cluster analysis tool.
  - added saveable settings (filenames for outcome tables)
  - added last path checked property to give some intelligence/memory to follow on file selections.
- Cluster analysis plots (access using context menu)
  - Added weekday score metric
    * Negative values indicate more weekend prevalence, positive values indicate higher weekday prevalence.
    * -1 indicates day of week distribution is entirely weekend (Saturday-Sunday)
    * +1 indicates distribution is entirely weekdays (Tuesday - Thursday).
  - Added distribution of unique participants per cluster.  
- Menubar: Changed "Analysis Mode" -> "View"
- Resolved issues
  - Transition issue (#102)
  - Analysis mode startup sync (#101)
  - Transition issue (#1)
  - Fixed export clusters to .txt file (some bugs from previous refactor.)


1.75 (11/01/2018)
- Cluster bootstrapping added to toolset.   
- Silhouette Index added to cluster quality metrics.
- Updates to import data [still beta]
- Updates for interacting with R applications [beta]
- Fixed "Hold on" checkbox performance when plotting centroids
- Update to handle centroid size selection change (from dropdown menu)
- Improving visualization for nonwear vs wear categories in secondary display axis
- Updates for display settings dialog (line and label properties).
- Updates for batch mode processing and data file preparation.
- Adding batch processing output of unaligned results.
- Resolving issue #98 (misplaced file/path utility functions)
- Updates for MySQL database interface (requires advanced setup)
- Adding in app documentation 
- Adding source code documentation
- Batch mode includes adjustable limit for number of days allowed per subject: 1 day, 7 days, or no limit.
- Added file menubar option to export clusters to .csv files for offline analysis.
- Median absolute deviation (MAD) added to feature functions.
- Contextmenu option added to recenter/redistribute signals in the time-series upper window.
- Corrected UI controls which were not disabled when loading results or individual studies.
- Height and width of screen can now be adjusted with the mouse.


1.65 - Added a directory sync button to batch mode for ease of setup (link input and output folder to same bath).
        - Added option to view log file after batch processing in the event that any errors occurred.
        - Remove view refresh in results mode when attempting to view a profile outside the valid range.  This removes unneeded flicker.

1.60 - Updated activity state classifier to output classification according to X, Y, and Z count values, and not just their vector magnitude.
        - Updated settings to select which axis to classify activity state from (Previously only vector magnitude was allowed).
        - Batch log files seen as context help in Batch tool (i.e. when mouse is placed over the output folder path).
1.55 - Added Power Spectral Density bands to feature selection.  
        - Increased feature resolution to allow frame sizes of 15, 30, and 60 seconds.	
        - Miscellaneous visualization and U/I improvements.
1.51 - Added custom option to day of week selection dropdown menu.
